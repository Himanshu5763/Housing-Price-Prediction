# Housing-Price-Prediction

The the goal of this project is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features affecting the price of the house. We employed techniques of data preprocessing and built a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.
The dataset contains information about various features of housing and is often used to predict the median value. The target variable in the dataset is MEDV, which is the median value of homes, and the goal is often to predict this value based on the other features. This dataset is useful for practicing regression techniques and understanding the impact of various factors on housing prices.
